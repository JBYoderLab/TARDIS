# TARDIS

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A package for modeling plants' population processes in relation to environmental variation, using observations distributed in spaaaace and tiiiime.

README last updated 21 November 2025.

## Installation

You can install the development version of TARDIS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("JBYoderLab/TARDIS")
```

## References and examples

TARDIS was originally developed for analysis of flowering events by Joshua trees, *Yucca brevifolia* and *Y. jaegeriana*, with results described in 

> Yoder JB, AK Andrade, LA DeFalco, TC Esque, CJ Carlson, DF Shryock, R Yeager, and CI Smith. 2024. Reconstructing 120 years of climate change impacts on Joshua tree flowering. *Ecology Letters*, 27, e14478. [doi.org/10.1111/ele.14478](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14478)

We have since extended the method (and formally given it the super-cool name) in a study of toyon, *Heteromeles arbutifolia*, with explicit comparison to a "conventional" presence-based SDM.
