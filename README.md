TARDIS was originally developed for analysis of flowering events by Joshua trees, *Yucca brevifolia* and *Y. jaegeriana*, with results described in

We have since extended the method (and formally given it the super-cool name) in a study of toyon, *Heteromeles arbutifolia*, with explicit comparison to a "conventional" presence-based SDM.
